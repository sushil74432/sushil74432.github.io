jQuery Quiz I
1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?
->  jQuery function is the function provided by jQuery library that is accessed using the $ symbol and is used 
    to select elements from the DOM or perform operations on the DOM.

    jQuery object is the object that is returned by a valid jQuery function when used to select DOM elements.
    This object consists of the DOM elements and set of methods that are provided by the jQuery library. 



2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
color red.
Sample HTML:
<body>
<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>

->  To select just the immediate children h1 of a div element, following jQuery code works
    $("div>h1")

    But if we wish to select all the decendent h1 inside a div, following code can be used
    $("div h1)




3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
</body>
</html>


->  $('p').append("YES!")
